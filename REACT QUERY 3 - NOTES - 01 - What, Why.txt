REACT JS IS A LIBRARY and it has a library itself called REACT QUERY


#What?
React Query is a library to fetch data in a React application


#Why?
1. Since React is a UI library there is no specific pattern for data fetching

2. To replace useEffect hook for data fetching and useState hook 
   (to maintain component state like loading, error or resulting data)

3. If the data is needed throughout the app, we tend to use state management libraries

4. Most of the state managment libraries are good for working with client state. 
(manage local changes like theme style, modal is open or not)

5. State management libraries are not great for working with asynchronous or server state
