React Query Cache it to fetch and store internet resources to use them faster.
Every query result is cashed for 5 minutes and if you fetch again that data, you will fetch it from your computer

Cached data may have been updated in the server and React Query....triggers a background refetch for the same query 
------
Query made the first time
isLoading = true 
isFetching = true 
------
Query repeated or data updated 
isFetching = true 
-------------------------------------------------

useQuery( "description", functionFetch(), {cacheTime } )   // To change the time the data is cashed, use the 3 parameter

example: 
useQuery("Heroes", fetchHeroes,  {cacheTime: '5000'});     // 5000 milliseconds - 5 seconds
