React Query Cache it to fetch and store internet resources to use them faster.
Every query result is cashed for 5 minutes and if you fetch again that data, you will fetch it from your computer

Cached data may have been updated in the server and React Query....triggers a background refetch for the same query 
------
Query made the first time
isLoading = true 
isFetching = true 
------
Query repeated or data updated 
isFetching = true 
-------------------------------------------------

useQuery( "description", functionFetch(), {cacheTime } )   // To change the time the data is cashed, use the 3 parameter

example: 
useQuery("Heroes", fetchHeroes,  {cacheTime: '5000'});     // 5000 milliseconds - 5 seconds


CACHE TIME    how long to keep the fetched data stored on client's machine
STALE TIME    how ofter to refetch the data stored already on client's machine 
              stale time default value = 0 (EVERY TIME YOU QUERY THERE IS A BACKGROUND REFETCH)

useQuery("Heroes", fetchHeroes, { staleTime: '30000' })     //each 30 seconds refetch data to see if data is updated 

-------------------------------
data will be the same on page  
isLoading = false,  isFetching = false (for the next 30seconds) 
-------------------------------
after 30 seconds 
isLoading = false, isFetching = true;
