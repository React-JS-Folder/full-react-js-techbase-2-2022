REACT QUERY - useQuery onSuccess, onError

To create side effects to queries 

{
   onSuccess: functionName,
   onError: functionName2
}

const showOnSuccess = () => {
   console.log("useQuery connection was successfull");
}

const OnError = () => {
   console.log("useQuery connection was not possible");
}


const {data, isLoading, etc} = useQuery(x,x,{ 
   onSuccess: showOnSuccess,   
   onError,                   // if the function has same name as the property, just add the property 
})

REACT QUERY CAN ALSO ADD FLAGS TO THE FUNCTIONS AS PARAMETERS
