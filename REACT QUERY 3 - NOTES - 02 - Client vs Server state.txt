CLIENT VS SERVER STATE 

Client state 
- Persisted data in your app memory and accessing or updating it is synchronous

Server state 
- Persisted data remotely and requires asynchronous APIs for fetching or updating
- Has shared ownership

- Data can be updated by someone else without your knowledge, (UI data may not be in sync with the remote data)

- Challenging when you have to deal with catching, deduping multiple requests for the same data, updating stale data in the background, performance optimizations, etc
